# üìÑ Advanced Resume Shortlister (Java)

## üìå Overview

The **Advanced Resume Shortlister** is a **Java-based program** that automates the shortlisting of resumes against job requirements.
It parses resumes, extracts features such as **skills, experience, education, certifications, and projects**, and then ranks candidates using a **weighted scoring system**.

This project demonstrates **multi-threaded resume parsing, text extraction, regex-based analysis, and weighted scoring logic** for recruitment automation.

## üí° Future Enhancements

* Integrate **Apache PDFBox** for real PDF text extraction.
* Use **NLP techniques** for smarter skill/project extraction.
* Add **GUI or Web Dashboard** for non-technical users.
* Extend to integrate with **ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)**.



üëâ Do you want me to also include a **ready-to-use sample job\_requirements.txt, technical\_skills.txt, and soft\_skills.txt** in the repo so you (or others) can run it immediately without creating files manually?
